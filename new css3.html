<!-- 
white-space is a CSS property that helps control how whitespace and line breaks within an element's text are treated.

The white-space property can take these values:

normal: The default value. Multiple whitespaces are collapsed into one. The text wraps to the next line when needed.
nowrap: Multiple whitespaces are collapsed into one, but the text doesnâ€™t wrap to the next line..
pre: Same results as using the <pre> where all the whitespaces will be kept as is and the text only wraps when line breaks are in the content.
pre-line: Multiple whitespaces are collapsed into one, the text breaks to the next line when needed or with line breaks in the content.
pre-wrap: Similar to pre, but the text also wraps when needed.

	<!-- 		word-wrap:break-word; is work when a sentence is going out of box
	but some spaces is left, to overcome this we use word-break:break-all; it takes care of spaces and sentences which is going out of box
